# Expense Tracker Application

This is a simple Expense Tracker web application built using React. The app allows users to add both **expenses** and **income** entries, categorized by type (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment, Salary, Tip). It helps users track their finances by distinguishing between expenses and income, without manually entering negative values for expenses.

## Features

- **Add Expense**: Users can input the expense details, amount, and type (e.g., Food, Transport).
- **Add Income**: Users can also add income transactions like Salary and Tip.
- **Expense Categorization**: Transactions are categorized into expenses and income based on the selected type.
- **Amount Calculation**: The amount is automatically handled as positive for income and negative for expenses.
- **Transaction List**: Displays all the added transactions with amounts and types.
- **Real-time Updates**: The app updates the balance whenever a new transaction is added.
- **Smart AI-Powered Chatbot** : The app will feature a chatbot to help users interact with their transactions, providing financial advice, answering questions, and assisting with categorization using AI. This feature is currently under development.
